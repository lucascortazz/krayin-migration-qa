# Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating Krayin CRM from Laravel (PHP) to Django (Python).

## Migration Approach

### 1. Parallel Development Strategy
- Maintain Laravel system in production while building Django equivalent
- Implement feature parity before switching
- Gradual migration with rollback capabilities

### 2. Component-by-Component Migration
- **Phase 1**: Authentication and User Management
- **Phase 2**: Core CRM Features (Leads, Contacts, Deals)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (Activities, Reports)
- **Phase 4**: API Migration
- **Phase 5**: Data Migration and Cutover

### 3. Technology Stack Comparison

| Component | Laravel | Django |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Framework | Laravel 8+ | Django 4.2+ |
| Database | MySQL | PostgreSQL |
| ORM | Eloquent | Django ORM |
| Templates | Blade | Django Templates |
| Authentication | Laravel Auth | Django Auth |
| API | Laravel API | Django REST Framework |
| Frontend | Vue.js/Blade | Vue.js/Django Templates |

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- User acceptance testing

### 5. Success Criteria
- 100% feature parity
